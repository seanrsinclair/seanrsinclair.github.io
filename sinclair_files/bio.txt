Sean Sinclair is a final-year Ph.D. student in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University coadvised by Christina Lee Yu and Siddhartha Banerjee. His research focuses on developing algorithms for data-driven sequential decision making in societal applications. He bridges algorithmic techniques in reinforcement learning to an operations management perspective with an emphasis on models, data uncertainty, and objectives.

Sean was selected for the 2022 Future Leaders Summit at the Michigan Institute for Data Science. In 2020 and 2022 he was a visitor at the Simons Institute for the programs on the Theory of Reinforcement Learning and Data-Driven Decision Processes. During the Summer of 2021 he was a research intern at Microsoft Research under Adith Swaminathan.  He graduated with a B.S. in Honours Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University. Before returning to graduate school he spent two and a half years teaching mathematics, science, and English in a small community in rural Ghana with the Peace Corps, and after worked at National Life as a financial analyst.
